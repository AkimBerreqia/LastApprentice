Hollow Knight Silksong has just released a few weeks ago and I'm currently waiting to see Demon Slayer, Infinite Castle at the cinema (on this Friday !!). So I decided to start working on a game combining both vibes. I hope I will maintain my motivation to work on this project during this semester :)
